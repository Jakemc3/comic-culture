# Methods of Research

For our research we used two primary databases: [Comic Book DB](http://www.comicbookdb.com/) and [Mike's Amazing Comics](http://www.dcindexes.com/). Both of these databases feature extensive catalogs of comic books and relevant information such as publisher and release date. Mike's focuses more on the Detective Comics publisher, but both were suitable for our research since we were focusing on the Batman comics series. Both sites feature their own challenges when it comes to collecting data. Mike's was compiled by one individual who is a comic enthusiast who is also a programmer. There was some doubt has to how comprehensive the database was, but upon review it encompases a considerable amount of information about the DC publisher. One challenge we faced when using [Web Scrapper](http://webscraper.io/) was scrapping all entries when searching for Batman. The results page would only display the first fifty entries and we were not able to make the application scrape the rest of the entries. We were able to remedy this problem somewhat by searching for Batman comics in alphabetical order.

Comic Book DB presented even more challenges than our previous database. The way in which the data was was entered into the database caused many failed attempts. The price was unselectable with webscraper and this complication affected our dataset. While we were sadly unable to obtain the price for each comic, we were able to succesfully scrape the database. The name and release date of each comic was entered onto the same line, so we were forced to scrape it all as one entry. The [openrefine](http://openrefine.org/) tool allowed us to seperate the 11,000 entries with a few mouse clicks. Our other set of data from Mike's was also tansformed using openrefine. We used it to merge several different spreadsheets of data.


After using openrefine we uploaded our Excel sheets into [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/). Tableau was not difficult to use, but we did encounter some difficulties based on the limited data we had to use. Our visualizations would have been bolstered if we had been able to scrape comic information such as page count and price.
