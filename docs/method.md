# Methods of Research

For our research we used two primary databases: http://www.comicbookdb.com/ and http://www.dcindexes.com/. Both of these databases feature extensive catalogs of comic books and relevant information such as publisher and release date. dcindexes.com focuses more on the Detective Comics publisher, but both were suitable for our research since we were focusing on the Batman comics series.
