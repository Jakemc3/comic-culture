# Project Goals

This project is designed to look at specific comic books and identify thier similarites and differences between issues. There are more comic books in existence than we can resonably scrape in the narrow time frame of our project. Therefore, we limited our scope to include one series of a comic book and extracted information about that one particular series.
We chose the Batman comic series due to popularity and the large amount of comic books that have been published under the name over the last century. Our initial aim was to gather information that included pricces, page counts, and even story arcs. Sadly we have to lower these ambitions due to technical limitations. In the future we hope to revisit this project and find a way to gather all of the data necessary.

Our goals are to gather data on as many issues of the Batman comic book title as we can find. We will be gathering information such as title name and relase date. We will use this data to look at how Batman has evolved over the years and what spinoff series under the Batman umbrella have been created.
