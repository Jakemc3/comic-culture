Batman is one of the most iconic literary characters ever created. Over the past century he has gone from battling Hitler and the Nazis on comic pages to having his own animated series and even being portrayed in multiple live action films that have grossed millions. Many people know the Dark Knight and his alter ego billionaire Bruce Wayne, but not many know the impact he has had on comic and human history. Comic books have evolved in the same way Batman has. What was originally a visual book aimed at children is now enjoyed by adults as books, movies, video games, clothing, and various forms of memorabilia. We will examine Batman comic books that have been released over the last century and compare which Batman titles were the most popular and which years featured the highest number of comics released.
